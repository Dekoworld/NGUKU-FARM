              <h5>Parent stock breeding: </h5>
              <p>The number of males and females in any breeding flock is important. If there are too few
                males, overall fertility may suffer. Likewise, if there are too many males, they may
                fight
                and fertility may also suffer. The viability of the males may vary from flock to flock,
                and
                the exact number of males must be left to the judgment of the production manager.</p>
